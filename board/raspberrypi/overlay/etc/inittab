# Note: BusyBox init doesn't support runlevels.  The runlevels field is
# completely ignored by BusyBox init. If you want runlevels, use
# sysvinit.
#
# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# id        == tty to run on, or empty for /dev/console
# runlevels == ignored
# action    == one of sysinit, respawn, askfirst, wait, and once
# process   == program to run
#
# sysinit: Entries of this type are executed before init tries to access the console
#          (that is, before the Console Login: prompt). It is expected that this entry will
#          be used only to initialize devices that init might try to ask the run level
#          question. These entries are executed and init waits for their completion
#          before continuing.
# 
# respawn: If the process does not exist, then start the process; do not wait for its
#          termination (continue scanning the inittab file), and when the process dies,
#          restart the process. If the process currently exists, do nothing and continue
#          scanning the inittab file.
# 
# wait:    When init enters the run level that matches the entry’s rstate, start the process
#          and wait for its termination. All subsequent reads of the inittab file while init
#          is in the same run level cause init to ignore this entry.
#
# once:    When init enters a run level that matches the entry’s rstate, start the process,
#          do not wait for its termination. When it dies, do not restart the process. If init
#          enters a new run level and the process is still running from a previous run level
#          change, the program is not restarted.
